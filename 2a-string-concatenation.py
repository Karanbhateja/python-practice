first_name = "Mr"
last_name = "Robot"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# To add space between first and last name either add space after Mr or before Robot os you can also concatenate space like strings in full_name variale.

print(full_name)

# You can;t add number with string like print(first_name + 3) because you can only add string with string.
# But you can do

print(first_name + "3" + str(4) ) # Because now 3 is not a number, it is a string
# You can also write str(3) instead of "3"

print(first_name*3)
# You can multiply a string to print it multiple times.

# NOTE - Only string can be added (Concatenated) to a string integer cannot be concatenatted to a string
